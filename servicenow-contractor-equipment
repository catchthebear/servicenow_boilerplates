Hello XXXX,
 Haas IT received a notification that Gerri Bock has been hired with a
 start date of 11/01/2023.
 We noticed this is a contract position with End Date 10/01/2024.
 Please let us know if any equipment is needed for your new hire. Otherwise
 we will go ahead and close this ticket out next week.

 NOTE: Since XXXXX is a contract position, we may offer a hand-me-down
 laptop (in great condition) free of charge. If you'd like anything newer,
 we will need a chart-string to proceed with that purchase.
 Thanks
 Haas Technology Solutions
