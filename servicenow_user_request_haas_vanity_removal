Hi XXXX,

If you have used the "@haas" email alias in the past or signed up for other things/sites using the "@haas" email alias, please look over the following recommendations:

1. Add a message to your email signature alerting your email recipients of the change in email address. In your bMail Settings >> All Settings >> Accounts, set your default account to your @berkeley.edu email address and select the option "Always reply from default address".

2. Alternatively, or in addition, you can set up an auto-reply message alerting people who have emailed you that your Haas Alias is going away and to contact you directly at your @berkeley.edu email address going forward.

2a. How to create an auto reply for emails: https://knowledge.workspace.google.com/kb/how-to-create-an-auto-reply-for-emails-000007410

Please let me know if you would like to configure the above before we delete the email alias. We would then wait for 30 days before we delete the email alias so your your contacts can be updated accordingly.

If you rather we just delete the alias, we can do that as well but any email sent to the "@haas" email alias will bounce.

Please let me know what your thoughts are so we can get the process started.

Thanks,

Robert
