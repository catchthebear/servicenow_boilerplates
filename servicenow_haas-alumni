As of September 6, 2023, UC Berkeley is no longer accepting new requests for alumni email accounts. However, Berkeley Haas will continue to offer business school alumni an email forwarding service.

Please go to the link below to add your account to the priority list:

I'm also going to move your ticket to the "Berkeley Haas" alumni queue in case your have additional questions.


Best,

Robert
