Hi 

Could you please draft a message that mentions the reboot of some (not all) Wireless Access points at Haas?

When: Wednesday; 4/19/2023; 6:00 AM to 7:00AM
What: Wireless Access Points will be restarted
Why: Wireless Access point devices will be configured to work on newer network equipment 

IMPACT: Some Wi-Fi services will be unavailable while wireless devices reboot.

Thanks,

Robert
